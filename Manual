To compile: open the directory containing the .java files in terminal. Run the command 'javac *.java'
To run: on the same terminal, run the command 'java Casino'

No other configurations are required. The Monte Carlo simulations will run automatically and results will be posted shortly afterwards.

Program was written and tested on my home computer but it's basic Java code so everything should work everywhere, hopefully.

Everything is correctly solved and perfectly coded (except for the billion lines of code that repeat, I'm so sorry)
